# Hangman
Hangman is a guessing game written in Ruby language. Player tries to guess a pre-defined word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses

## Rules
When the game starts, the player will guess a letter. If that letter exists in the word then the letter will appear. If the letter doesn't exist in the word then a body part is added to the gallows (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg). The player will continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word (or phrase) or all six body parts are on the gallows.
